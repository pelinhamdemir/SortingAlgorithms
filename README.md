Sorting project includes:

N integers from a file and that creates a random array and uses the insertion sort algorithm.
insertion sort algorithm such that it sorts the input integer array in descending order, and start sorting the array FROM-RIGHT-TO-LEFT.
the Insertion sort algorithm with an array of double values
top-down Merge Sort algorithmwith the input integer array in descending order.
a Student class. Each student have three fields: a String name, a long id, a int semesterNo. The Student class should implement the Comparable interface to be able to compare Student objects with respect to their source and destination. The Student objects are first ordered (alphabetically) with respect to their ID. If their ID are the same, they are ordered (alphabetically) with respect to their semestorNo. If semesterNo are also same, they are ordered (alphabetically) with respect to their name. 
the Quick Sort method with the given Student objects. For this purpose, 10 different Student information from student.txt file must be considered.Student object for all students’ information in student.txt must be created. Then, this method is called to sort these objects with respect to name, id and semesterNo in ascending order. Student.txt has always 10 students’ records.
